Hi, Thanks for visiting my webpage. 
I am a PhD student in Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences. By profession, I am a Mechanical engineer but my main interest is in the mathematical approaches to understand the physical phenomenons. I love to do things related to thinking. I love to read literatures of history, evolution of society, languages. I can play an Indian classical music instrument, Bamboo Flute.
