Hi, Thanks for visiting my webpage. 

I am a PhD student in Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences. By profession, I am a Mechanical engineer but my main interest is in the mathematical approaches to understand the physical phenomenons. Currently, I am interested in the study of Wormhole formation in porous rocks due to reactive flow. I love to do things related to thinking. I love to read literatures of history, evolution of society and languages. I can play an Indian classical music instrument, Bamboo Flute. Now a days, I realised that to jot down something conclusive from my thorough thinking process, I should start writing the blogs. So I am writing my first blog and will update here soon.

I look forward to see you again, perhaps for my blog.
