Hi, Thanks for visiting my webpage. 

I am a PhD student in Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences. By profession, I am a Mechanical engineer but my main interest is in the mathematical approaches to understand the physical phenomenons. I love to do things related to thinking. I love to read literatures of history, evolution of society, languages. I can play an Indian classical music instrument, Bamboo Flute. Now a day, I realised that to jot something conclusive ideas of my thorough thinking  I should start writing the blogs. So I am writing my first blog and will upadte here soon.

I look forward to see you again, perhaps for my blog.
