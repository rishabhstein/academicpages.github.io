This presentation was about the development and testing of a numerical scheme, Nodal Integral Method (NIM). NIM is well known for its coarse-grid properties in nuclear engineering. Recent development in NIM for solving fluid flow problems effected its coarse grid accuracy especially for curved boundaries. I developed this scheme for curved boundaries to improve its accuracy with coarse grid in the field of fluid flow and transport phenomenon.
